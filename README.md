# 🤖 AI-Powered Weekly Business Report Generation (n8n & Gemini)

This project demonstrates a robust, scheduled automation built using n8n to connect business metrics and leverage AI (Google Gemini) for automatic report generation, ensuring stable delivery via email.

## 1. Project Overview & Use-Case

### 💡 Identified Business Problem & AI Augmentation

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Business Problem** | Manual process of collecting metrics, analyzing trends, and writing weekly narrative reports—a process that is slow and error-prone. |
| **AI Augmentation** | The AI (Gemini) takes raw, structured metrics, performs instant analysis (identifies trends, peaks), and **generates a complete, narrative report draft** directly in **HTML format**. |
| **Tech Stack** | **n8n** (Orchestration), **Google Gemini** (AI), **JavaScript** (Data Prep), **Google Sheets** (Data Source), **Email/SMTP** (Delivery). |

## 2. Workflow Concept & Data Flow

The workflow is a scheduled, linear process designed to convert raw metrics into a professional, HTML-formatted report.

| Step | Component | Action/Data Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Trigger** ⏰ | **Schedule Node** | Initiates the workflow weekly at a set time. |
| **2. Data Pull** 🗄️ | **Data Source Node** | Retrieves structured performance metrics (Sales, Traffic). |
| **3. Data Prep** 📝 | **Code Node** | Aggregates the metrics into a single, clean text/JSON block for the AI prompt. |
| **4. AI Logic** 🧠 | **Google Gemini Node** | Analyzes the data and generates a full report draft in **HTML**. |
| **5. Validation** ❓ | **IF Node** | Checks if the AI generated any content before sending the email. |
| **6. Output** 📧 | **Email Node** | Sends the finalized HTML report to stakeholders. |

## 3. Core Implementation Details

### 🧠 AI Prompt & Logic

The core of the project is the Gemini prompt, engineered to produce reliable, formatted output:

1.  **Direct HTML Output:** The prompt explicitly mandates **HTML formatting** to bypass issues with Markdown rendering in email clients.
2.  **Persona:** The AI is instructed to act as an "Expert Business Analyst" to ensure a professional tone.

```markdown
# AI Prompt Key Instruction
"...The report must be formatted using clean, standard HTML for direct email embedding. Do not use Markdown syntax. Use appropriate tags like <h1>, <h2>, and <table>."

### 🛡️ Stability and Validation

The workflow is designed for robustness and error handling to maintain a stable automation flow:

| Node | Function | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IF Node** ❓ | Checks if `$json.text` (AI Output) **is not empty**. | Prevents blank emails from being sent to executives by validating the AI's output before delivery. |
| **Fallback Node** 🚨 | Sends an immediate Slack/Email alert on the **False** path. | Ensures the team is notified instantly if the automation fails, enabling quick manual intervention. |
| **Node Retries** | Configured on the Data Source, Gemini, and Email Nodes. | Handles transient failures (network errors, API rate limits) without stopping the workflow. |

### 🗃️ Export to Sheets (Structured Output)

A final step in the workflow ensures the AI-generated data (Summary, Triage Action) is written to a structured source (Google Sheets/Airtable) to maintain a persistent and searchable record of all reports.

## 4. Getting Started

1.  **Download the Blueprint:** Download the `AI-Powered-Report-Generation.json` file from this repository.
2.  **Import:** Import the JSON file directly into your self-hosted or cloud n8n instance.
3.  **Credentials:** Update the credentials for the **Data Source Node**, **Google Gemini Node**, and the **Email Node** with your specific API keys and accounts.
4.  **Run:** Manually execute the workflow once to confirm all connections are working before letting the **Schedule Node** take over.
